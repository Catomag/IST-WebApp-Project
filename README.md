# IST-WebApp-Project
IST WebApp Project for IST class 2019

Here is my amazing project

Problem statement:
An easy-to-use website that allows for quick and seamless question-making that is easy to use and scalable. The web application requires very little from the client as most of the code is handled server-side. Very little skill is required to host and/or join a session, giant moving text tells the user what to do and very simple and non-obtrusive visuals are used to guide the user. The target audience for this web application are people who need to interview large amounts of people in short notice, so teachers, public speakers and presenters are likely to find the application useful. In order to develop the app, I used the free code editor Atom created by GitHub which allowed me to not only upload my code to the cloud, but to also work offline and to use various useful community made extensions to make development faster. I used Github to back up my files during development.
